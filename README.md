#PrivateMessageSystem

PrivateMessageSystem is a messaging system made in PHP which allows users to log into their account and have conversations with other users. It utilizes MySQL to store all conversations.
It also has a 'group chat' feature which utilizes Ajax to allow users to have very fluid conversations with all other users in a group scenario without having to refresh the page.
